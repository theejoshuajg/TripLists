# TripLists
Basic Description:
Display list of trips

This code has a start page that leads to a list of all the trips in an array. Each trip has its own path for more information. There is also an add trips button that allows you to enter a new trip with the needed information. There are also exit buttons on each page in order to allow the user to be able to easily travel back and forth between pages.

I used a navigation stack in order to be able to traverse between all the different pages. I also utilized a boolean variable in order to check which trip is clicked. I have an environmental variable called dismiss in order to be able to exit all the pages easily. In order to help with the visuals I added small icons and used the color yellow to match our theme. The add trip section used built in features from swift in order to get the needed information from the user.
